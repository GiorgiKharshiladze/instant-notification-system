This is an instant notification system for Administration to maintain connection with their staff and keep them updated

It is recommended to create virtual environment first by running `virtualenv -p {PYTHON PATH} {NAME}`

Default {PYTHON PATH}: `/usr/local/bin/python3`

Default {NAME} of the virtual environment: `venv`

If `virtualenv` command is not found `pip3 install virtualenv`

When the virtual environment is created, activate it using `source {NAME}/bin/activate`, where default {NAME} is `venv`

After virtualenv is active, install all the dependencies of the project by running `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
